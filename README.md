#Global Trade Analysis
The objective of the project was to create innovative and interactive Tableau dashboards that focus on potential commodities, countries, year, trade amount and quantity.  The client wanted to launch a new business unit, focusing on global trade and logistics, majorly in the countries such as USA, Canada and Australia.
